And one really nice thing that I learned on the arrays lesson, is that Swift arrays implement copy-on-write. But what does that mean?</p><p>Copy-on-write is a pattern that aims to save storage or memory allocation whenever it is possible by delaying copying a resource as long as it is possible. The copy only happens when someone writes on that resource, in other words, when someone edit, delete or add any information to it.</p><p>It is way easier to understand with some code, so here it goes.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">var originalArray = [1,2,3]
var copyArray = originalArray

originalArray.withUnsafeBufferPointer { (pointer) in
  print("originalArray: \(pointer)")
}
copyArray.withUnsafeBufferPointer { (pointer) in
  print("copyArray: \(pointer)")
}

print("Editing copyArray...")
copyArray[2] = 20

originalArray.withUnsafeBufferPointer { (pointer) in
    print("originalArray: \(pointer)")
}
copyArray.withUnsafeBufferPointer { (pointer) in
    print("copyArray: \(pointer)")
}
</code></pre><p>In the example above, I use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/array/2994771-withunsafebufferpointer">withUnsafeBufferPointer</a> to get access to the pointer of the starting address of the array. When the code is executed, it outputs the following:</p><pre><code>originalArray: UnsafeBufferPointer(start: 0x0000600002ca3320, count: 3)
copyArray: UnsafeBufferPointer(start: 0x0000600002ca3320, count: 3)
Editing copyArray...
originalArray: UnsafeBufferPointer(start: 0x0000600002ca3320, count: 3)
copyArray: UnsafeBufferPointer(start: 0x0000600002cd95a0, count: 3)
</code></pre><p>You can see that prior to the edition of <code>copyArray</code> both arrays are stored at the same memory address, and only after I did a write operation on it all the values from <code>originalArray</code> were copied over to another memory address, so than the copy could be edited without changing anything at the original.</p><p>Since this all happens under the hood, in most cases it makes no practical difference if you are aware of this language characteristic. But maybe you have a really specific situation where you want to give more context to the code by reassigning one array to a different name, and now you know that you will be paying basically nothing for it in terms of memory usage.</p><p>Thank you for reading, take care, and good coding!</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer><script src="/css/highlight/highlight.pack.js"></script><script src="https://getinsights.io/js/insights.js"></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
