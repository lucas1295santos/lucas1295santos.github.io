This post is a cheat sheet with examples on how to use ranges.</p><h2>What is a range?</h2><p>A range comprises a collection of elements between a certain lower and upper bound, bounds which might be included or excluded. The simplest use case of ranges that you might have seen, is to iterate on a <code>for</code> loop.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">for _ in 0 ..&lt; 5 {
    print("Hello world") // prints Hello world 5 times
}
</code></pre><h2>Cheatsheet</h2><h3>Ranges to iterate</h3><p><code>...</code> is a closed range, meaning that it <strong>includes the upper and lower bound</strong>.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">for count in 0...3 {
    print(count) // prints 0 1 2 3
}
</code></pre><p><code>..&lt;</code> is a half-open range, meaning that it <strong>excludes the upper bound</strong> while <strong>includes the lower bound</strong></p><pre><code class="language-swift">for count in 0..&lt;3 {
    print(count)
}
</code></pre><p>So if you want to iterate through a full array, you probably want to use a half-open range.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
for index in 0..&lt;arr.count {
    print(arr[index]) // prints 1 3 5 7 9
}
</code></pre><p>Otherwise, you would crash the program with an index out of range exception.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
for index in 0...arr.count {
    print(arr[index]) // prints 1 3 5 7 9 and than CRASHES because it will try to access the index 5 which doesn't exists.
}
</code></pre><h3>Ranges to slice arrays</h3><p>It's easy to create <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/arrayslice">array slices</a> using ranges, as the same logic of iterations applies here. It is also super useful to use ranges in their unary operator version. Let's take a look at some ways to slice an array in half.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let midpoint = arr.count / 2 // takes the middle index in this case 2, so arr[midpoint] would be 5 here.
let slice = arr[...midpoint] // creates an ArraySlice&lt;Int&gt; off the array from the first index (0) to the midpoint (2), including it.
for element in slice {
    print(element) // prints 1 3 5
}
</code></pre><p>If you don't want the midpoint you can just use the half-closed range <code>..&lt;</code> instead</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let midpoint = arr.count / 2 // takes the middle index in this case 2, so arr[midpoint] would be 5 here.
let slice = arr[..&lt;midpoint] // creates an ArraySlice&lt;Int&gt; off the array from the first index (0) to the midpoint (2), excluding it.
for element in slice {
    print(element) // prints 1 3
}
</code></pre><p>And if you want the right half of the array, you can use the closed range <code>...</code> postfixed.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">let arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let midpoint = arr.count / 2 // takes the middle index in this case 2, so arr[midpoint] would be 5 here.
let slice = arr[midpoint...] // creates an ArraySlice&lt;Int&gt; off the array from the midpoint(2) to the end of the array (4).
for element in slice {
    print(element) // prints 5 7 9
}
</code></pre><p>Strangely, there is no half-closed range postfixed.</p><h3>Ranges in Enums</h3><p>It is not possible to directly associate ranges to Enum cases like this</p><pre><code class="language-swift">// This doesn't work
enum ScoreClassification {
    case awesome = 90...
    case good = 70..&lt;90
    case average = 40..&lt;70
    case bad = ..&lt;40
}
</code></pre><p>To work around that, you could make custom init on your enum and <code>switch</code> through the ranges.</p><pre><code class="language-swift">enum ScoreClassification {
    case awesome
    case good
    case average
    case bad
    
    init(score: Int) {
        switch score {
        case 90...:
            self = .average
        case 70..&lt;90:
            self = .good
        case 40..&lt;70:
            self = .average
        default:
            self = .bad
        }
    }
}

let scoreClassification = ScoreClassification(score: 87)
print(scoreClassification) // prints good
