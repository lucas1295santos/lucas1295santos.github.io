description: Recently, I discovered [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish), a static website generator that uses Swift, written by [John Sundell](https://swiftbysundell.com).<br></br> The main idea is to declare all the pieces of your website like a *Swift Package*, and then using [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot) to generate HTML code using the type-safety of Swift, and finally using [Ink](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Ink) to render posts written in **Markdown**. (like this one!) <br></br> It may sould like a lot of tools to handle, but in reality Publish already does the most of the work for you.
